# the STOP g.APP
This is a repository of scripts, documents and data associated with the "the STOP g.APP" RShiny app.
<br />
## The 'fast_stops_gh.r' file : 
This is the script used for identification of proximal in-frame stops using Ensembl biomaRt. <br />
### Key steps: 
**Gets all transcripts** - Pulls all transcripts with a 'protein coding' biotype from Ensembl. Note - this also includes a small number of transcripts that are truncated at the 5' end. <br />
**Gets coordinates and sequences** - For each of the identified transcripts, gets coordinates and sequences for mappings. <br />
**Finds all possible stops** - For each transcript, identifies all possible stops in the 3'UTR (mRNA) and drops any not in frame with the original stop. <br />
**Gets proximal stop** - Identifies which of the in-frame stops is closest to the original stop. <br />
**Calculates additional metrics** - Pulls together relevant info for each transcript to be displayed in the app. <br />
<br />
## The 'ALL_ENS_rescue_stops.txt' and 'plot_stops.txt' files: 
Files generated by fast_stops_gh.r. Used for producing in app tables, and plots respectively. <br/>
<br />
## The 'app.R' file 
**RShiny app to display the nearest in-frame stop and all associated data on a per-transcript basis**
## The 'www' folder 
**Logos and graphics used in the app**
